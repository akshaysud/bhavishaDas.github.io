				Hi everybody, my name is Bhavisha but everybody calls me Bhiv or B. I’m
				23 and I’m from a small town called Otaki in the Kapiti Coast but for
				the past 6 years I’ve been living in Auckland. I’m studying at Dev
				Academy for the same reason as many of you I was recently made redundant
				from Flight Centre and i’m looking for a change of career that I can
				take anywhere in the world. I’ve only recently started getting an
				interest in computers so I thought why not see where it can take me.
				Something I strongly value is friendship and family without them I
				wouldn’t be where I am. I believe who you chose to surround yourself
				around speaks volumes… Also wine because it keeps me sane lol
