			Core Personal Values

		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			One of my core values is work ethic and being honest to the work I
			undertake. I really don't appriciate when people don't follow up with
			their commitments. <br />

			When the lockdown started, we in the team knew that we will be made
			redundant soon. Before that though, we had a heap of bookings which were
			supposed to be cancelled. Being in sales, cancelled bookings meant losing
			on a heap of money along with the redundancy looming. <br />

			I had a to make a decision. It was either to sit at home and enjoy the
			wage subsidy knowing that I was close to loosing my job
			<strong>OR</strong> front up the harsh reality and get the work done<br />

			I chose the later and it felt right. Didn't make a change in my paycheck
			but I felt I had done the right thing. <br />

			I feel that this comes from growing up in a household where I have seen
			everyone hustle. I feel greatful to have grown up in an atomosphere where
			hardwork is recognised.
